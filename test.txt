Definition:
- Subjective relativism is the idea that morality are relative to the individual.
- What is right for one person may not be right for another.
- This is just for morality, but some people take it to another extreme and say that truth is also relative, and there are no such thing as facts. 
- This one is easier to reject since there are evidence that can be aligned with, such as the nature of the physical world.
- Morality is a bit more complex. For example, lying cannot be always wrong, parents lie to their kids about sensitive topics, to protect their innocence.

Pros and Cons:
- Pros:
-- It values all views, and respects the diversity of opinions. After all, being able to think differently makes each of us special, its why mankind keeps on thriving, its the beauty of the human mind.
-- It also helps alleviate ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism is when you judge people of other cultures based on standards of your own culture. So if everybody respects each others' view then this won't be a problem.
- Cons:
-- If there's no objective norms, disagreements will be pointless, conflicts cannot be resolved because people just agree to disagree every time. There will be no progress, no improvements in the society.
-- This is a big mental block for critical thinkers like us. Because the idea of critical thinking is that there exist some standards that transcend beyond our individual view, which makes us able to be right or wrong about certain things. Because of that, we can figure out what is certainly right, likely right ,or likely wrong, etc.
-- If everyone is right in their own way, you know is gonna be a mess since people are surprisingly good at justifying bad behaviors. For example, the German guy with the rectangular mustache, hes crazy but i must admit, he overcooked, literally. So yes, the theory undermines justice, its hard to criticize anything.

Conclusion:
- The best way to think about this theory is that itself is also relative. So you can choose to accept it or not, its totally fine.
- If all this is too much, you can consider the theory of i-don't-care-ism, that is fine as well.
